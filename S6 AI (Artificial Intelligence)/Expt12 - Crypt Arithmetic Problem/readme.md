# Aim
To implement basic search strategies – Crypt arithmetic.

# Theoretical Background
The Crypt-Arithmetic problem in  Artificial Intelligence is a type of encryption problem in which the written message in an alphabetical form which is easily readable and understandable is converted into a numeric form which is
neither easily readable nor understandable. The crypt-arithmetic problem deals with converting the message from the readable plain text to the non-readable ciphertext. 
The constraints that this problem follows during the conversion are as follows:
- A number 0-9 is assigned to a particular alphabet.
- Each different alphabet has a unique number.
- All the same, alphabets have the same numbers.
- The numbers should satisfy all the operations that any normal number does.

# Algorithm
- 1. The code starts by declaring a variable called num.
- 2. It is initialized to 0 and then it starts looping through the word, assigning a value of 10 for each letter in the word.
- 3. The assignment statement assigns an integer value to every character in the string.
- 4. The code continues by checking if any of the first letters are zero or if any of the last letters are zero.
- 5. If either one is true, then that means there was no valid assignment and so this function returns false which will cause our program to stop running at that point.
- 6. The code is written to find the value of a word in an assignment.
- 7. The code begins by declaring two variables, num and assigned.
- 8. The first variable, num, will store the number of times that letter appears in the word.
- 9. The second variable, assigned, stores the letters in the word with their corresponding values.
- 10. Next, a for loop is created which iterates through each character in the word.
- 11. In this loop we check if any letter has been set to zero or not assigned at all.
- 12. If either condition is true then it returns false and stops iterating through characters within that iteration of the loop.
- 13. Otherwise it increments num by 10 and assigns its value to assigned [char].
- 14. This process repeats until all characters have been checked for
- 15. The code is a function that takes in three arguments: word1, word2, and result.
- 16. The function is called solve and it returns the solutions to the equation of word1 + word2 = result.
- 17. The first line of code assigns values to letters so that they are sorted alphabetically by their value.
- 18. This is done with set () because each letter has two possible values (A-Z or a-z).
- 19. The next line creates an empty list named assigned which will hold all the possible assignments for words 1 and 2.
- 20. Next, we iterate through 10 numbers from 0-9 using range ().
- 21. We then check if any number not in assigned is found by checking if it&#39;s not in the list of letters (assigned) .
- 22. If there isn&#39;t one yet, we create a new letter at index cur letter with pop (), assign num to it with assignment operator (=), then call _solve (word1, word2, result) on our solution list created earlier
- 23. Then we remove cur letter from assigned so that only A-Z remain as valid characters for assigning values to words 1 and 2 respectively.
- 24. The code is the solution to a word puzzle.
- 25. It will take in two words and assign them to a result.
- 26. The assignment can be done by finding values in the words, or by assigning letters to numbers.
- 27. The first line of code assigns the value of 1 to letter &quot;a&quot; and 2 to letter &quot;b&quot;.
- 28. This is done with find value ().
- 29. The next line assigns 3 to letter &quot;c&quot;, 4 to letter &quot;d&quot;, 5 to letter &quot;e&quot;, 6 to letter
- 30. The code is trying to find the number of solutions.
- 31. The code starts by checking if len (result) &gt; max (len (word1), len (word2)) + 1 or len (letters) &gt; 10, which means that it will stop searching when either one of those conditions is met.11
- 32. Then, the code creates a list called solutions and iterates through each solution in order to print out its contents.
- 33. The first line says &quot;CRYPTARITHMETIC PUZZLE SOLVER&quot;.
- 34. This is just an example of what you might see on your screen after running this program.
- 35. The code will print 0 Solutions!
- 36. If the input is not a word or number.
- 37. The code above will then iterate through the list of solutions and print them out.
