# Aim:
Write a program to implement a simple chatbot.

# Theoretical Background:
A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet. It can interact with users via text or voice inputs and provide answers to their questions or complete tasks
for them. Chatbots are often used in customer service, e-commerce and other applications to automate and streamline interactions with users.

# Algorithm:
- Step 1: Start.
- Step 2: Create a list of questions and corresponding answers that the chatbot can use to respond to the user.
- Step 3: Write a function that takes in a user input and returns the corresponding answer from the list. This function can use string matching or natural language processing techniques to determine the intent of the user’s message.
- Step 4: Use the ‘input()’ function to get the user’s message.
- Step 5: Pass the user’s message to the response function and save the returned answer.
- Step 6: Use the ‘print()’ function to display the chatbot’s response to the user.
- Step 7: Repeat steps 4-6 until the chatbot is closed or the user decides to end the conversation.
- Step 8: Stop.
